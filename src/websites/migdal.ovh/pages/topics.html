<h2 class="hrl2">Trust in online secure transactions</h2>
<div class="hrl2">My PhD works focus on privacy-compliant multi-modal user biometric authentication, to this extend, I proposed a <a href='/publications/2018-icissp'>Privacy Identity Code Respecting Privacy</a>. I also proposed a method to protect user privacy through anonymisation of its keystroke, as well as a method to <a href='/publications/2019-fgcs'>generate synthetic Keystroke Dynamics</a> in a journal at <?= ext_link('FGCS (Q1)', 'https://www.journals.elsevier.com/future-generation-computer-systems', 'share'); ?>. I also collaborate with the <a href='/relations/reg'>University of Reggio Calabria</a> on <a href='/publications/2017-cw'>identity verification on Social Networks</a>.

<h2 class="hrl2">OTDP and TLS Switching</h2>
<div class="hrl2">Authentication protocols generally assume that clients (s.a. computers and smartpones) are secured. We argue that malwares can corrupt clients (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/src/uploads/2014/07/Pandalabs-2015-anual-EN.pdf" data-toggle="tooltip" title="PandaLabs Annual Report of 2015" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external">32% of computers are infected by a malware <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-share"></span></a>) and modify their expected behavior. In order to bring security to the client-side, we delegate sensitives operations (s.a. passwords inputs and signatures computations) to an external device assumed incorruptible, a <em>trusted device</em>.<br/>

As part of my training, I made two internships (3 and 5 months) at the <a href="/relations/uio">University of Oslo</a> on the <?= ext_link('OffPAD project', 'https://www.offpad.org/', 'share'); ?>, proposed by the <?= ext_link('OffPAD consortium', 'https://www.offpad.org/node/1.html', 'share'); ?>, resulting of <a href="/publications/2016-acmccs">6 demonstrators</a> presented at the <?= ext_link('ACM CCS 2016', 'https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2016/index.html', 'share'); ?> A* conference. We also proposed a new trusted device architecture (OTDP) and a 3-party usage of TLS (TLS Switching) in <a href='/publications/2017-siot'>a publication</a> at <?= ext_link('SiOT (ESORICS Workshop)', 'http://siot-workshop.org/', 'share'); ?></a>.</div>
